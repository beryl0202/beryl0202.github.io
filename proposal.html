<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<p>I plan on making a html-based project. I plan on adding more to my project I made for Technics and Time. I made a website with a transcript I added manually. Therefore, it will be shown as a website with a playable video to the class. I also plan on adding more accessibility features. I will add user input to rate the transcript and ask for the user's feedback. Another feature I will add are some radieo buttons for the users to check and a simple box design for users to type their input. </p>
<p>I want a website that focuses on accessibility and encourages user feedback for future improvements. I want to present to the class a website where the user watches a video with transcript and then offers ways to improve the viewing experience. </p>

<ul>
    <li> I will add a feedback section below the video that will ask the user questions on how to improve the viewing experience. </li>
    <li> I will add radio buttons and/or checkboxes so the users can choose the options they want to answer the prompt with. </li>
    <li> I have not decided where the user feedback box will exactly be on the website but it will be a box for the users to write in and give feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p> To achieve these certain steps, I will need to learn how to implement checkboxes, radio buttons, and box designs that allows user to type inside it. 
    <br>I can use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp"> HTML documentation website</a> to learn how to implement these features into my video website.</p>
    <br>I can also refer to Youtube if I need more resources to learn how to implement these features into my website. 
    <br>To document my progress, I will use Git commit messages and (just in case) a github HTML file to document my progress.
