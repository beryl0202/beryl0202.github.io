        <h5> Light Pollution Map</h5>
        <p>The light pollution maps help readers see how much of North America is impacted by light pollution. According to the National Park Service, more than 99% of Americans are affected by light pollution. These light pollution maps show how light pollution has the highest amount of lighting in populated states such as New York, Illinois, and Washington, D.C. </p>
        <h5>Light Pollution and Light Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>Light pollution occurs most commonly in dense, urban populations. Light pollution affects humans, fish, insects, birds, and other animals. Humans are unable to view the night sky clearly. Migratory fish and birds are unable to migrate properly. 
            For example, certain insects like moths and flies are attracted to light; they will stay near the light source until they die of exhaustion. Light pollution also affects the circadian rhythms of animals; bees are one example of an animal that requires rest at night and needs to be constantly active during the day. Furthermore, the problem of light pollution will only get worse. The electricity infrastructure is going to play a larger role in light pollution as the years increase. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity consumption will increase by 1.7% per year. 120 terawatt-hours of energy are used in the United States per year for outdoor lighting and street lights.
